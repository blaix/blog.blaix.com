I am Justin Blake. You are cool.

I write about programming here.

I put quotes, links, and short writings about programming on my [tumblr](https://blaix.tumblr.com/).

I post a bunch of nonsense on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/blaix).

This blog is built with [jekyll and hosted on github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).
The source code is nothing special but [you can read it](https://github.com/blaix/blog.blaix.com) if you want.
